	<div>
		<p>Just a couple of animal lovers that started a small home-based hobby ... in Lexington, Kentucky. We have two labradoodles in our family and decided we wanted to spread the joy that we have gotten from them to others. Since we got our dogs we have fed them only high-quality dog food (Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Preformatrin, Stella and Chewy's) and kept up with their overall health, physically and mentally.</p>

		<p>We ensure that the puppies will have the same love and care that our two have gotten while they are with us and hope to find them the same love in their future home.</p>

		<p>We guarantee that our puppies will be up to date on vaccinations and deworming and they also come with a health guarantee and a health certificate issued by our veterinarian.</p>

		<p>While they are with us they will be given lots of attention and training is started early with work on basic commands, leash conditioning, and socialization plus lots and lots of toys to play with. Our goal is to nurture our pups so they can blossom into well behaved furry family members. </p>
