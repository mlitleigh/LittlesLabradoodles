        <p>
            We have three labradoodles in our family and have decided to spread the joy that we have gotten from them to others.
            <br><br> Our dogs have been fed only high-quality dog food (Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Pro Plan, Stella and Chewy's) and we are intentional about keeping up with their overall health, physically and mentally. 
            <br><br> Through this philosophy, we desire our puppies to have the same love and care that we give our dogs and hope to find them the same love in their future home.
            <br><br> We guarantee our puppies will be up to date on vaccinations and deworming. They also come with a health guarantee and a proof of health check, issued by our veterinarian.
            <br><br> While they are with us they will be given lots of attention and training is started early with work on basic commands, leash conditioning, and socialization plus lots and lots of toys to play with. Our goal is to nurture our pups so they can blossom into well behaved furry family members.
